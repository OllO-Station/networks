## Introduction

OLLO is a sovereign L1 chain built on the [Cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos) network, providing next-gen trading tools & sustainable [tokenomics](https://docs.ollo.zone/about/tokenomics). This repository stores data, metadata & assets for different chain versions of OLLO Station, both in testnet and mainnet.

We're currently in the testnet phase of our development. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pVCk6BDS) or follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OLLOStation) account for updates.
