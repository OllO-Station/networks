In this folder, you will find resources corresponding to the `ollo-testnet-1` OLLO Station network chain ID.

This is where we will keep record of upgrades, genesis transactions, chain & asset metadata, and compiled peer/seed lists.

We encourage anyone who would like to contribute to reach out to us on the OLLO Station Discord, or submit a pull request if they would like to have their peer/seed node listed.
